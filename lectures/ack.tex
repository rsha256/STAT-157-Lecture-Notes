{\textbf{Acknowledgements}}
I would like to recognize and thank Professor Alexander Strang for all information contained in these notes. 

Thanks to Leon Ma who typeset'd the notes for Lecture 9.

Disclaimer: These notes are high-level and mainly capture verbal notes not on the blackboard -- there's much more detail on the board with verbal details and drawings. As such, this represents only a subset of what the class covers.
